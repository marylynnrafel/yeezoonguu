All aboard the hype train. Our World War ( 8.4/10 The Red Baron. Beneath Hill 60 is a 2010 World War I film that tells extraordinary true story of Oliver Woodward (Brendan Cowell), a former miner turned military officer leading a unit fighting for the Australian Army in 1915 who must must tear himself from his new young Let me start off by saying that World War 1 was extraordinary. Heavy artillery, bayonet charges, barbed wire, poison gas. But WW1 was also horrific. Years stuck in the same deep trenches, tens of thousands of men getting cut down by machine guns the moment they left the trench, brutal hand-to-hand combat if troops somehow managed to even make it across no-man's-land. Did you know that soldiers often sharpened their entrenching shovels to use as weapons? That's metal as fuck. Beneath Hill 60 adds a new and little known chapter to the Aussie legend and an impressive cast and crew have inscribed forever a new and haunting entry in the national historical ledger.

'Beneath Hill 60' is a true story based on a front-line campaign in Belgium in 1917. This is a war film unlike any other.
